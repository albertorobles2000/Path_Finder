# Path Finder
Path finder which use diferent algorithms such as A* or minimal cost, write in python using pygame and numpy


## How can I execute it on my computer?
To execute the **path finder** you should first have python 3 installed on your computer.

Then you must install these packages to be able to run the program:

1.PYGAME
```bash
pip install pygame
```
2.NUMPY
```bash
pip install numpy
```
To execute it you should open a terminal get into the **Path_Finder/** folder and write:
```bash
python path_finding.py
```
  
  
## How does it work?
1. First you must select an Algorithm and press **Start**

2. When you have selected an algorithm you should select the start rectangle that you prefer, just clicking over it with the mouse

3. Then you have to choose the objective rectangle, clicking over the one you prefer

4. Now fell free to draw as many walls as you want and create any types of labyrinths, just by clicking or dragging over the rectangles

5. At this point to start the path finfing just press **enter** and the algorithm will start

6. As you will see when it finds the goal rectangle it will draw the path, if you want to go back to the **Main Menu** just press **enter**
